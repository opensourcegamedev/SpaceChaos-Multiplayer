 * conjunction with {@link SpaceChaosMultiplayerGame}.
 * <p>
 * Assets have to be marked via the {@link Asset}-Annotation and then the game
 * loads these the first time the screen is {@link Screen#show() shown}. The
 * {@link #onInit()}-method is called after the loading process to allow
 * initializing the screen. To manually load the assets i.e. when implementing a
 * loading screen, one has to call {@link #finishLoading()} after finishing to
 * load the assets.
